      <p>Anton Kogan grew up in Skokie, Illinois (where he felt he never quite fit in), and graduated from the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana(where he didnâ€™t fit in either). He spent ten years working at the Chicago Board of Trade in the derivaties trading field, where he was a (much-abused, under-appreciated) trader in the Dow Jones Futures pit. After selling his membership (because he was done with the soulsucking financial industry) he worked as an Operations Manager for BridgeStreet Global Hospitality, a corporate housing provider (he had an office with a nice view, but still did not fit in). He currently lives in Chicago (where he feels like he fits in) with his wife.</p>
